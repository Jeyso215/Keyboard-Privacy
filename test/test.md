## Test Functionality:
You can use my simple html and javascript live.html site i created to test inside the inspect element console to see your keystrokes data.

1. Open a text input area (like a text editor or a form) and type normally. 

2. The extension works by randomizing the rate at which characters are sent to the DOM, which helps prevent behavioral profiling.

3. You can observe if there are any noticeable delays or changes in how your input appears compared to typing without the extension.

## Monitor Performance:

Use the extension for a period of time and note any changes in your browsing experience or keyboard responsiveness. If you encounter issues, consider disabling the extension to compare performance.
